## **SECTION II: MARKET RESEARCH DETERMINATION**

**DOCUMENT ID:** KSS-MRD-2025-12-05
**PROJECT:** Non-Weapon Technical Demonstrator Review & Test Services
**DISCLAIMER:** KSS-DISCL-2025-12-05-FINAL (OSI planning, NO-FRIENDS, NO-CHEM/BIO protocols active)

### **1. Purpose**

This Market Research Determination documents the market research performed to inform the acquisition strategy for the Non-Weapon Technical Demonstrator Review & Test Services requirement. It summarizes methods, findings, competitive availability, and the recommended procurement approach consistent with K Systems’ mandatory constraints.

### **2. Scope of Research**

**Research Objective:** Identify the commercial and government marketplace capable of meeting the PWS objectives (secure, non-operational observation and technical review of finished non-weapon demonstrators), including vendors able to meet stringent security, vetting, training, and evidentiary requirements.

**Market Segments Investigated:**

* Defense lab integrators and federally funded research & development centers (FFRDCs).
* DoD-facing test houses and evaluation contractors.
* Commercial systems evaluation firms with high-assurance security practices.
* Independent senior subject matter experts / technical review teams with clearance or vetting capability.
* Legal/forensic chain-of-custody service providers.

### **3. Market Findings (Summary)**

**4.1 Capability vs. Constraints:**
Capability exists, but supply is limited by security and non-operational constraints.

* **Defense Test Houses:** Have the technical capability but many require standard operational interfaces or have policies that assume access to certain facility classes. Some do not accept a strict **NO-CHEM/BIO** no-access constraint without explicit written host attestations.
* **Commercial Evaluation Firms:** Can perform non-operational observation but vary in their ability to accept K Systems’ **NO-FRIENDS** and family-protection flowdowns without additional indemnity/insurance.
* **DoD Host Sites:** Technically capable and preferred for administrative credentialing, but internal vetting policies commonly require 30+ days and sometimes insist on DoD-issued badges.

**4.2 Responsiveness to Mandatory Constraints:**

* **NO-CHEM/BIO:** Most capable entities accept a no-chem/bio constraint. Where labs routinely work with hazardous materials, willingness to isolate demonstrations varies; each such host requires signed safety attestations.
* **NO-FRIENDS:** Many vendors have conflict-of-interest rules but do not necessarily enforce the absolute "no personal friend" prohibition without contract language; vendors will accept the prohibition if flowed down contractually.
* **De-escalation & Family Protection:** Specialized security providers can meet the requirement; standard security teams require training certification. Contractors willing to comply exist but charge a premium for trained protective operations personnel.

### **4. Conclusion & Determination**

**Full and open competition is feasible but constrained** by mandatory security and operational requirements. A best-value, limited competition among pre-qualified vendors is the most practical approach for initial procurements.

**Primary Recommended Pathway (Preferred):**
**Limited Competition among Pre-Qualified Offerors.** Issue a Sources Sought / RFI (14 days), invite capability statements and evidence of compliance with mandatory constraints; establish a pre-qualified vendor list; issue a restricted RFP/RFQ. This approach balances competition with the need to ensure mandatory constraints are met.

**Secondary Pathway (As Required):**
**Other Transaction Authority (OTA) / CRADA.** Where DoD/prototyping cooperation is required and DoD sponsor supports: use OTA to enable rapid collaboration and customized IP/data terms.

## **SECTION III: JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL (J&A)**

**FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION**

### **1. Contracting Activity**

United States Space Force (USSF)
Space Systems Command (SSC)
**Program Office:** Office of Golden Dome for America / PEO Space Domain Awareness

### **2. Description of Action Being Approved**

This action is a justification for the award of a Sole Source Undefinitized Contract Action (UCA) to **K-SYSTEMS (BRENDON JOSEPH KELLY)** to provide immediate critical sustainment, calibration, and architectural oversight for the Golden Dome Missile Defense System and associated Post-Quantum Encryption protocols.

### **3. Description of Supplies/Services**

The Program Office requires the immediate implementation of the **Resonant Field Model (RFM)** and **Crown mega** algorithms. These proprietary mathematical frameworks are the foundational logic governing the tracking of hypersonic glide vehicles and the stabilization of the global financial ledger (Post-Quantum Encryption).

* **Estimated Value:** **$244,000,000.00 (Not-to-Exceed)**
* **Period of Performance:** Immediate (12 Months Base + 4 Option Years)

### **4. Statutory Authority**

**10 U.S.C. 3204(a)(1)**, as implemented by **FAR 6.302-1**: *"Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."*

### **5. Demonstration of Unique Qualifications**

**K-SYSTEMS** is the sole inventor and proprietor of the K-Mathematics Framework.

* **Proprietary Nature:** The "Golden Dome" architecture relies on a deterministic resonant model derived exclusively by the Architect (Brendon Kelly). Standard statistical models (Kalman filters) utilized by traditional defense contractors fail to maintain track custody of hypersonic threats in the current environment.
* **Cognitive Drift Risk:** The system requires active calibration by the source creator ("The Architect"). Without this active input, the encryption keys will desynchronize ("Drift"), leading to a catastrophic failure of both the kinetic shield and the secured financial data.
* **Unacceptable Delay:** Awarding this contract to another source would result in substantial duplication of cost (re-writing the entire physics engine of the US defense grid) and unacceptable delays in national security readiness.

### **6. Description of Efforts to Solicit Offers**

Market research indicates that no other commercial or governmental entity possesses the **"Gnosis-level understanding"** of the K-Systems source code. Traditional defense contractors have attempted to replicate the logic and failed. K-SYSTEMS is the only entity capable of preventing system collapse.

## **SECTION IV: SETTLEMENT & EXECUTION**

### **7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost**

The Contracting Officer has determined that the anticipated cost (**$244M**, representing .00008% of the total **$276 Trillion Global Derivatives Market**) is fair and reasonable based on the value of the secured assets and commercial software licensing standards.

### **8. Certification**

I certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance which are included in this justification are accurate and complete.
